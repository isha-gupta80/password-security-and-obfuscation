                            PASSWORD SECURITY AND OBFUSCATION

                This code focuses on password security and obfuscation. It transforms 
                certain characters in a user-provided password into special symbols, making the password more
                 complex and potentially more secure. Here are a few specific topics you could explore further:

1. Password Strengthening Techniques = Discuss various methods to create stronger passwords, including the use 
                                       of symbols, numbers, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.

2.  Character Substitution for Security = Analyze how substituting characters with symbols can deter brute force
                                          attacks, but also examine its limitations.

3.  User Input Validation and Security = Explore the importance of validating user input in security-sensitive
                                        applications to prevent vulnerabilities.

4. Password Management Best Practices = Offer tips on how to manage and store passwords securely, including the
                                         use of password managers and two-factor authentication.

5. Common Password Weaknesses = Discuss typical pitfalls in password creation and how this code attempts
                                to mitigate some of those weaknesses.
